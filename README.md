Abstract:   Smoking has always been seen as a way to de-stress in stressful situations. Nowadays, electronic cigarettes climbed their way into the market. It has been popularized amongst young adults, but even made its way to teenagers, who would normally not have the legal age to purchase a pack of cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes, most commonly known as vapes, are trending very fast among the youth. An issue that may raise concerns are the effects of vaping on health, as well as the safety of individuals. In this study, VapeFree looked into how it could help its users dim down the electronic cigarette consumption, while providing some advice and tips that are beneficial for them. We have conducted our study over 15 participants that are active vape users. Overall, the participantsâ€™ experience was positive, as everyone found something appealing and helpful form our application. Most of our participants were shook about their consumption, since tracking your consumption is not something you would normally think of doing. We received some positive feedback as to how we could make this platform a more enjoyable experience and features to incorporate to help our users to become completely free of vaping.<br>
